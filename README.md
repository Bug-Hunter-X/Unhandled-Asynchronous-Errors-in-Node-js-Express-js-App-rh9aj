# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: unhandled errors within asynchronous functions.  The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a solution using appropriate error handling techniques.

**Problem:**

Asynchronous operations, such as those using `setTimeout` or database queries, can throw errors that aren't immediately caught.  If not handled properly, these errors can lead to application crashes and unexpected behavior.

**Solution:**

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to properly handle asynchronous errors using `try...catch` blocks within the asynchronous function or by using promises and `.catch()` for error handling.  Proper logging is also important for debugging.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in asynchronous Node.js applications to prevent unexpected crashes and improve application stability.
